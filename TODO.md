# Spektra - TODO

## UI Changes

- [ ] File upload field should be hidden / shown with uploaded file
- [ ] File should be manually deloaded before another file is uploaded (explicit upload/deload) -> with x button or something
- [ ] Show / Hide should be better -> not showing the canvas if the file isn't uploaded
- [ ] Layout of the audio metadata / Upload / canvas should be more modular and dimensionally well collapsed based on the use of the component

## Functionalities

- [ ] Show actual Spectogram of the uploaded audio file
- [ ] Show Real Time Spectrum Analysis?
- [ ] Show the relevant information on the audio analysis -> see other software that does this
- [ ] 3D Rendering of both the time and frequency domain for show casing the FFT algorithm

## Academic

- [ ] Divide and Conquer Visualization? -> Purely for the algorithmic visualization, not for the app itself
